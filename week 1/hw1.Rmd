```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```


# 1. Importing Dataset
```{r customers}
customers <- read.table("./customers.txt",header=TRUE)
```


```{r}
summary(customers)
```

# 2. Questions

1. The fifth element in the dataset
```{r}
customers$age[5]
```
We can see the the fifth entry in the dataset if `45`. However, if we weren't sure about it, we could print out the first twenty entries of the dataset.

```{r}
customers$age[c(1:20)]
```
As we can see here, the fifth entry is definitely `45`.

# 3. Data Visualization
```{r ageplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(customers, aes(x=age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10)
```
